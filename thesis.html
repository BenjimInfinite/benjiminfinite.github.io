        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>This thesis addresses the design and implementation of a trading system in the cryptocurrency market, aimed at maximizing profit while reducing risk. The system uses a control-based approach to predict price direction, rather than focusing solely on statistical price predictions. A combination of methodologies like SINDy (Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics) and Model Predictive Control (MPC) is applied to identify system dynamics and optimize trading strategies.</p>
    </div>

        <h2>Introduction and Problem Statement</h2>
        <p>The cryptocurrency market is known for its high volatility, presenting challenges in identifying profitable trading opportunities. This project focuses on developing a system that improves profitability while managing risks by using control theory and machine learning techniques to optimize trading decisions.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Main Problem:</strong> High volatility in crypto markets makes it difficult to predict price movements accurately.</li>
            <li><strong>Objective:</strong> Develop a system that predicts market trends and adjusts trading strategies dynamically to maximize profits while minimizing risks.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Methodology</h2>
        <p>The system uses a multi-step approach involving both classical control methods and machine learning:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>System Design:</strong> The control system is designed using methodologies such as Proportional-Integral (PI), Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR), and Model Predictive Control (MPC) for optimizing trades.</li>
            <li><strong>Price Prediction:</strong> A key feature is predicting price direction (rise or fall) using binary classification models, rather than predicting exact prices.</li>
            <li><strong>System Identification:</strong> The SINDy algorithm is used to identify the system's dynamics and derive the equations governing its behavior.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Results and Conclusions</h2>
        <p>The proposed control system, optimized through MPC, performed significantly better than random strategies. Key findings include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Improved profitability by dynamically adjusting the take-profit and stop-loss levels.</li>
            <li>Effective management of trading risks through a combination of control techniques and machine learning algorithms like Random Forest.</li>
            <li>Potential for future expansion to handle multiple cryptocurrencies and implement compounding strategies.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Future Work</h2>
        <p>The system can be further enhanced by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Incorporating additional cryptocurrencies into the portfolio to diversify risk.</li>
            <li>Introducing reinvestment strategies to exponentially grow the account size.</li>
            <li>Implementing more sophisticated risk management techniques for handling market correlations.</li>
        </ul>
