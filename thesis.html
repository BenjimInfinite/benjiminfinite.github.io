        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>Designing a trading system in the cryptocurrency market always poses numerous challenges, with one of the most critical being the recognition of price movements. This study moves away from using price prediction or currency direction as the basis for system formation. Instead, statistical methods are employed to handle the complexities of price prediction and enable profit optimization using control methods. By utilizing the SINDy system detection algorithm, both system inputs and outputs are determined, and the system's governing equations are derived. With these equations, a predictive control method is applied to minimize the cost function by estimating future system behavior. A risk manager further enhances the system, ensuring consistent profitability with two objective functions.</p>

        <h2>Introduction and Problem Statement</h2>
        <p>The cryptocurrency market presents significant volatility, making it difficult to predict price movements effectively. The goal of this project is to design a control-based trading system that enhances profitability while navigating the complexities of price fluctuations without directly relying on price direction predictions.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Key Issue:</strong> The high volatility and unpredictability of the crypto market.</li>
            <li><strong>Objective:</strong> Develop a system that optimizes profits using control theory, minimizing the need for precise price predictions.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Methodology</h2>
        <p>This system is developed through the following steps:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>System Identification:</strong> The SINDy (Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics) algorithm is used to identify the governing equations of the system, setting up the control framework.</li>
            <li><strong>Predictive Control:</strong> The Model Predictive Control (MPC) method minimizes the cost function by forecasting future system behavior based on identified equations.</li>
            <li><strong>Risk Management:</strong> A risk manager is implemented to ensure consistent profit by managing the inherent risks in crypto trading, with two objective functions balancing profit and risk.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Results and Conclusions</h2>
        <p>The developed system successfully navigated the challenges of cryptocurrency trading, producing consistent profits while effectively managing risks. The key results include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Effective identification of system equations using the SINDy algorithm.</li>
            <li>Profit optimization achieved through MPC by forecasting and adjusting system inputs dynamically.</li>
            <li>Risk management ensured stability and minimized losses, even in highly volatile market conditions.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Future Work</h2>
        <p>Potential future enhancements to the system include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Expanding the system to include multiple cryptocurrencies and portfolios.</li>
            <li>Implementing reinvestment strategies to maximize compound growth over time.</li>
            <li>Further refining the risk management approach to handle more complex market correlations.</li>
        </ul>
