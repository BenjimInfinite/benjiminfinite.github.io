        <h2>Long-Term Goal</h2>
        <h5>Leadership in a Meaningful Mission through Data Science</h5>
        <p><strong>Leadership</strong></p>
        <p>I am committed to advancing my leadership potential through a meaningful mission that leverages data science to address complex, real-world challenges. Whether as a university professor guiding future innovation or as a product manager driving strategic decisions in a major company, I am determined to make an impact where it matters most.</p>
        <p><strong>Meaningful Mission</strong></p>
        <p>For me, a meaningful mission spans across diverse fields. At an algorithmic trading startup, I contributed to solving demand and supply issues in financial marketsâ€”an area with significant economic and social impact. Beyond this, I am drawn to fields like cognitive behavior, personalized healthcare, and ethical AI, where data science can drive transformative change.
             My current aim is to explore these broad areas and identify where I can have the most profound effect. A meaningful and valuable goal can be achieved through deep research and a focused approach.</p>
        <p><strong>Why Data Science?</strong></p>
        <p>Data science is my chosen path because it enables the development of innovative solutions to complex problems. Its power lies in uncovering patterns and deriving insights from vast amounts of data, making it an indispensable tool for tackling the diverse challenges I am passionate about. Whether it's optimizing financial systems or personalizing healthcare, data science provides the foundation for meaningful innovation.</p>
