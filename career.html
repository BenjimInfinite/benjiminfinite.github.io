        <h2>Long-Term Goal</h2>
        <h5>Leadership in a Meaningful Mission through Data Approaches</h5>
        <p><strong>Leadership</strong></p>
        <p>I am committed to advancing my leadership potential through a meaningful mission that leverages data science to address complex, real-world challenges. Whether as a university professor guiding future innovation or as a product manager driving strategic decisions in a major company, I am determined to make an impact where it matters most.</p>
        <p><strong>Meaningful Mission</strong></p>
        <p>For me, a meaningful mission spans across diverse fields. At an algorithmic trading startup, I contributed to solving demand and supply issues in financial markets—an area with significant economic and social impact. Beyond this, I am drawn to many other fields. (see in the "Educational Prospects" card)
             My current aim is to explore these broad areas and identify where I can have the most profound effect. Achieving a meaningful and valuable goal requires deep research and a focused approach, which is why I am eager to join a research lab as a Master’s student.</p>
        <p><strong>Why Data?</strong></p>
        <p>Data Approaches or specifically Data science is my chosen path because it enables the development of innovative solutions to complex problems. In today’s world, data is everywhere—shaping decisions, driving innovation, and transforming industries. Its power lies in 
            uncovering patterns and deriving insights from vast amounts of information, making it an indispensable tool for tackling the diverse challenges I am passionate about. Whether it's optimizing
             financial systems or personalizing healthcare, data science provides the foundation for meaningful innovation in a world increasingly driven by data.</p>

        <h2>Career Pathways</h2>
        <p>My career path may evolve, but two distinct routes are clear after completing my Master’s degree:</p>
        <h3>1. Becoming a University Professor</h3>
        <p>In this path, I aim to contribute to both research and education by pursuing a PhD and eventually securing a faculty position. The key steps are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>2025:</strong> Begin my research-based Master’s degree, focusing on deepening my expertise in data science and its applications. This will also be a time for exploring potential PhD pathways and identifying areas of interest for future research.</li>
            <li><strong>2027:</strong> Complete my Master’s degree and start pursuing a PhD in data science or a related field. My focus will be on contributing to cutting-edge research, publishing papers, and collaborating with both academic and industry partners.</li>
            <li><strong>2027 - 2032:</strong> Continue advancing my research during my PhD, concentrating on impactful problems in my chosen field Alongside research, I will begin teaching responsibilities to develop my skills in education and mentorship.</li>
            <li><strong>2032:</strong> Complete my PhD and secure a postdoctoral or assistant professor position. At this stage, I will focus on building a strong research portfolio, applying for grants, and mentoring students. My long-term goal is to become a thought leader in my field, contributing to the advancement of data science in both academia and industry.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>2. Transitioning into Product Management</h3>
        <p>Alternatively, I could transition into product management, using data-driven insights to guide strategic product decisions at scale. The steps for this path are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>2025:</strong> Start my Master’s degree, focusing on expanding my technical knowledge and exploring areas of interest within data science and business intelligence.</li>
            <li><strong>2027:</strong> Graduate with a Master’s degree and begin working as a Junior Data Scientist, ideally in a research or industry role. Alongside, I will continue learning about product management through formal courses or self-study.</li>
            <li><strong>2027:</strong> Transition into a Senior Data Scientist role, gaining experience and technical expertise. During this time, I will focus on acquiring the skills needed to move into product management.</li>
            <li><strong>2032:</strong> Secure a Product Manager position, utilizing data science insights to drive product strategy and development. My goal is to make data-driven decisions that lead to innovation and impact.</li>
        </ul>
